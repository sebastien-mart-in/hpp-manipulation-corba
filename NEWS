* In graph component classes (State, Edge, Graph) locked joints are handled as other numerical constraints.
New in v4.6.1
* Remove deprecated methods and functions.
New in v4.6.0
* Update Robot class.
* Automatically generate EndEffectorTrajectory bindings.
* Add graph components to IDL.
 
New in v4.1
* Add ProblemSolver.addConfigValidation and ProblemSolver.clearConfigValidations.
* If dependency to QPOases is not set, do not implement static stability constr.
* Bind a few new methods in python:
  - Graph::getNode,
  - Robot::getJointBounds,
  - Robot::getPartialCom,
  - Robot::getJacobianPartialCom,
  - Graph::initialize,
  - Graph::isShort,
  - Path::edgeAtParam,
  - ProblemSolver::erasePath,
  - ProblemSolver::concatenatePath,
  - ProblemSolver::selectDistance,
  - ProblemSolver::selectSteeringMethod,
  - ProblemSolver::projectPath,
* Check that graph argument is a Boolean in ConstraintGraph.setConstraints.
* In ProblemSolver.getConstantRightHandSide, return False for locked joints.
* Add class Constraints to homogeneize various types of constraints
* Build Handle with mask instead of AxialHandle.
* In graph construction, use prebuilt placement constraints.
* Express dependency to hpp-template-corba
* Use ProblemSolver::createRobot to create robot of appropriate type.
* Remove idl method Robot::create.
* Add Problem::setTargetState.
* Copy handles and grippers when loading environment.
* Use ProblemSolver::createGraspConstraint and createPregraspConstraint
* Add insertRobotModelFromString and loadEnvironmentModelFromString.
