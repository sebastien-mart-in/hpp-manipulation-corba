class SecurityMargins:
    """
    Handles security margins between robots and objects in collision checking

    This class sets the requested security margins in \\link
    hpp::core::PathValidation PathValidation\\endlink instances of
    constraints graph \\link hpp::manipulation::graph::Edges
    edges\\endlink.

    \\sa hpp::core::ObstacleUserInterface::setSecurityMargins

    By default the security margin between objects or robots is set to 0
    It can be modified by changing the value of the class member
    \\c defaultMargin.

    A given security margin can be set for a pair of robots or objects by calling
    method \\link SecurityMargins.setSecurityMarginBetween
    \\c setSecurityMarginBetween \\endlink.

    Once appropriate margins have been set by the user, method
    \\link SecurityMargins.apply \\c apply \\endlink computes and sets for each edge
    and each pair of bodies security margins as required. However, along edges
    where two objects are requested to be close to each other, the security
    margin is set to 0. For instance
    \\li between a pregrasp and grasp configuration the security margin is set to
        0 between the gripper and the object to be grasped,
    \\li along an edge where an object lies in a stable position the security
        margin between this object and any object holding a surface over which
        it could be put is set to 0.
